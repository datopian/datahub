## Changelog

### v0.6 - Sprint 2013 (tbc)

Possible breaking changes

* Updated Leaflet to latest version 0.4.4 #220
* Added marker clustering in map view to handle a large number of markers
* Dataset.restore method removed (not used internally except from Multiview.restore)
* Views no longer call render in initialize but must be called client code
* Backend.Memory.Store attribute for holding 'records' renamed to `records` from `data`
