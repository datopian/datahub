# What is Portal.JS
🌀 `portal.js` is a framework for rapidly building rich data portal frontends using a modern frontend approach. `portal.js` can be used to present a single dataset or build a full-scale data catalog/portal.

`portal.js` is built in Javascript and React on top of the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) framework. `portal` assumes a "decoupled" approach where the frontend is a separate service from the backend and interacts with backend(s) via an API. It can be used with any backend and has out of the box support for [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

## Features

- 🗺️ Unified sites: present data and content in one seamless site, pulling datasets from a DMS (e.g. CKAN) and content from a CMS (e.g. wordpress) with a common internal API.
- 👩‍💻 Developer friendly: built with familiar frontend tech Javascript, React etc
- 🔋 Batteries included: Full set of portal components out of the box e.g. catalog search, dataset showcase, blog etc.
- 🎨 Easy to theme and customize: installable themes, use standard CSS and React+CSS tooling. Add new routes quickly.
- 🧱 Extensible: quickly extend and develop/import your own React components
- 📝 Well documented: full set of documentation plus the documentation of NextJS and Apollo.

### For developers

- 🏗 Build with modern, familiar frontend tech such as Javascript and React.
- 🚀 NextJS framework: so everything in NextJS for free React, SSR, static site generation, huge number of examples and integrations etc.
  - SSR => unlimited number of pages, SEO etc whilst still using React.
  - Static Site Generation (SSG) (good for small sites) => ultra-simple deployment, great performance and lighthouse scores etc

# Installation and setup
Before installation, ensure your system satisfies the following requirements:

- Node.js 10.13 or later
- Nextjs 10.0.3
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

> Note: We also recommend instead of npm using `yarn` instead of `npm`.
> 
Portal.js is built with React on top of Nextjs framework, so for a quick setup, you can bootstrap a  Nextjs app and install portal.js as demonstrated in the code below:

```bash=
## Create a react app
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```
After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing pages/index.js and see the result on your browser.

> For more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) documentation.

Once you have Nextjs created, you can install portal.js:

```bash=
yarn add https://github.com/datopian/portal.js.git
```

You're now ready to use portal.js in your next app. To test portal.js, open your `index.js` file in the pages folder. By default you should have some autogenerated code in the `index.js` file:


Which outputs a page with the following content:

![](https://i.imgur.com/GVh0P6p.png)

Now, we are going to do some clean up and add a table component. In the `index.js` file, import a [Table]() component from portal as shown below:

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head'
import { Table } from 'portal' //import Table component
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

export default function Home() {

  const columns = [
    { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID' },
    { field: 'firstName', headerName: 'First name' },
    { field: 'lastName', headerName: 'Last name' },
    { field: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
  ];

  const rows = [
    { id: 1, lastName: 'Snow', firstName: 'Jon', age: 35 },
    { id: 2, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Cersei', age: 42 },
    { id: 3, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Jaime', age: 45 },
    { id: 4, lastName: 'Stark', firstName: 'Arya', age: 16 },
    { id: 7, lastName: 'Clifford', firstName: 'Ferrara', age: 44 },
    { id: 8, lastName: 'Frances', firstName: 'Rossini', age: 36 },
    { id: 9, lastName: 'Roxie', firstName: 'Harvey', age: 65 },
  ];

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Portal App</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <h1 className={styles.title}>
        Welcome to <a href="https://nextjs.org">Portal.JS</a>
      </h1>

      {/* Use table component */}
      <Table data={rows} columns={columns} />

    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, your page should look like the following:

# Architecture / Reference

## Component List

Portal.js supports many components that can help you build amazing data portals similar to [this](https://catalog-portal-js.vercel.app/) and [this](https://portal-js.vercel.app/). 

In this section, we'll cover all supported components in depth, and help you understand their use as well as the expected properties. 

Components are grouped under the following sections:
* [UI](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/ui): Components like Nav bar, Footer, e.t.c 
* [Dataset](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/dataset): Components used for displaying a Frictionless dataset and resources
* [Search](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/search): Components used for building a search interface for datasets
* [Blog](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/blog): Components for building a simple blog for datasets
* [Views](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/views): Components like charts, tables, maps for generating data views
* [Misc](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/misc): Miscellaneous components like errors, custom links, etc used for extra design. 

### UI Components

In the UI we group all components that can be used for building generic page sections. These are components for building sections like the Navigation bar, Footer, Side pane, Recent datasets, e.t.c.  

#### [Nav Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/ui/Nav.js)

To build a navigation bar, you can use the `Nav` component as demonstrated below:

```javascript
import { Nav } from 'portal'

export default function Home(){

 const navMenu = [{ title: 'Blog', path: '/blog' },
                 { title: 'Search', path: '/search' }]
 
 return (
   <>
    <Nav logo="/images/logo.png" navMenu={navMenu}/>
    ...
   </>
 
 )
}
```

#### Nav Component Prop Types

Nav component accepts two properties:
* **logo**: A string to an image path. Can be relative or absolute.
* **navMenu**: An array of objects with title and path. E.g : [{ title: 'Blog', path: '/blog' },{ title: 'Search', path: '/search' }]


#### [Recent Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/ui/Recent.js)

The `Recent` component is used to display a list of recent [datasets](#Dataset) in the home page. This useful if you want to display the most recent dataset users have interacted with in your home page. 
To build a recent dataset section, you can use the `Recent` component as demonstrated below:

```javascript
import { Recent } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  const datasets = [
    {
      organization: {
        name: "Org1",
        title: "This is the first org",
        description: "A description of the organization 1"
      },
      title: "Data package title",
      name: "dataset1",
      description: "description of data package",
      resources: [],
    },
    {
      organization: {
        name: "Org2",
        title: "This is the second org",
        description: "A description of the organization 2"
      },
      title: "Data package title",
      name: "dataset2",
      description: "description of data package",
      resources: [],
    },
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Use Recent component */}
      <Recent datasets={datasets} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

Note: The `Recent` component is hyperlinked with the dataset name of the organization and the dataset name in the following format: 

> `/@<org name>/<dataset name>`

For instance, using the example dataset above, the first component will be link to page:

> `/@org1/dataset1`

and the second will be linked to:

> `/@org2/dataset2` 

This is useful to know when generating dynamic pages for each dataset. 

#### Recent Component Prop Types

The `Recent` component accepts the following properties:
* **datasets**: An array of [datasets](#Dataset)

### Dataset Components

The dataset component groups together components that can be used for building a dataset UI. These includes components for displaying info about a dataset, resources in a dataset as well as dataset ReadMe.

#### [KeyInfo Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/dataset/KeyInfo.js)

The `KeyInfo` components displays key properties like the number of resources, size, format, licences of in a dataset in tabular form. See example in the `Key Info` section [here](https://portal-js.vercel.app/). To use it, you can import the `KeyInfo` component as demonstrated below:
```javascript
import { KeyInfo } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  const datapackage = {
    "name": "finance-vix",
    "title": "VIX - CBOE Volatility Index",
    "homepage": "http://www.cboe.com/micro/VIX/",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "license": "PDDL-1.0",
    "sources": [
      {

        "path": "vix-daily.csv",
        "format": "csv",
        "size": 20982,
        "mediatype": "text/csv",
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Use KeyInfo component */}
      <KeyInfo descriptor={datapackage} resources={datapackage.resources} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### KeyInfo Component Prop Types

KeyInfo component accepts two properties:
* **descriptor**: A [Frictionless data package descriptor](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#descriptor)
* **resources**: An [Frictionless data package resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#introduction)


#### [ResourceInfo Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/dataset/ResourceInfo.js)

The `ResourceInfo` components displays key properties like the name, size, format, modification dates, as well as a download link in a resource object. See an example of a `ResourceInfo` component in the `Data Files` section [here](https://portal-js.vercel.app/).

You can import and use the `ResourceInfo` component as demonstrated below:
```javascript
import { ResourceInfo } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  const resources = [
    {
      "name": "vix-daily",
      "path": "vix-daily.csv",
      "format": "csv",
      "size": 20982,
      "mediatype": "text/csv",
    },
    {
      "name": "vix-daily 2",
      "path": "vix-daily2.csv",
      "format": "csv",
      "size": 2082,
      "mediatype": "text/csv",
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Use Recent component */}
      <ResourceInfo resources={resources} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### ResourceInfo Component Prop Types

ResourceInfo component accepts a single property:
* **resources**: An [Frictionless data package resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#introduction)


#### [ReadMe Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/dataset/Readme.js)

The `ReadMe` component is used for displaying a compiled dataset Readme in a readable format. See example in the `README` section [here](https://portal-js.vercel.app/).

> Note: By compiled ReadMe, we mean ReadMe that has been converted to plain string using a package like [remark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark).

You can import and use the `ReadMe` component as demonstrated below:
```javascript
import { ReadMe } from 'portal'
import remark from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'


const readMeMarkdown = `
    CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) time-series dataset including daily open, close,
    high and low. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market
    expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option
    prices introduced in 1993.

    ## Data

    From the [VIX FAQ][faq]:

    > In 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange® (CBOE®) introduced the CBOE
    > Volatility Index®, VIX®, and it quickly became the benchmark for stock market
    > volatility. It is widely followed and has been cited in hundreds of news
    > articles in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other leading financial
    > publications. Since volatility often signifies financial turmoil, VIX is
    > often referred to as the "investor fear gauge".

    ## License

    No obvious statement on [historical data page][historical]. Given size and
    factual nature of the data and its source from a US company would imagine this
    was public domain and as such have licensed the Data Package under the Public
    Domain Dedication and License (PDDL).

    [historical]: http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/historical.aspx
`

export default function Home() {
  const [readMe, setreadMe] = useState("")

  useEffect(() => {
    async function processReadMe() {
      const processed = await remark()
        .use(html)
        .process(readMeMarkdown)
      setreadMe(processed.toString())
    }
    processReadMe()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <ReadMe readme={readMe} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

#### ReadMe Component Prop Types

The `ReadMe` component accepts a single property:
* **readme**: A string of a compiled ReadMe in html format. 

### [View Components](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/views)

View components is a set of components that can be used for displaying dataset views like charts, tables, maps, e.t.c. 

#### [Chart Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/views/Chart.js)

The `Chart` components exposes different chart components like Plotly Chart, Vega charts, which can be used for showing graphs. See example in the `Graph` section [here](https://portal-js.vercel.app/). 
To use a chart component, you need to compile and pass a view spec as props to the chart component. 
Each Chart type have their specific spec, as explained in this [doc](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/views/#graph-spec).

In the example below, we assume there's a compiled Plotly spec:

```javascript
import { PlotlyChart } from 'portal'

export default function Home({plotlySpec}) {

  return (
    < div >
      <PlotlyChart spec={plotlySpec} />
    </div>
  )
}

```
> Note: You can compile views using the [datapackage-render](https://github.com/datopian/datapackage-views-js) library, as demonstrated in [this example](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/examples/dataset-frictionless/lib/utils.js).


#### Chart Component Prop Types

KeyInfo component accepts two properties:
* **spec**: A compiled view spec depending on the chart type. 

#### [Table Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/examples/dataset-frictionless/components/Table.js)

The `Table` component is used for displaying dataset resources as a tabular grid. See example in the `Data Preview` section [here](https://portal-js.vercel.app/). 
To use a Table component, you have to pass an array of data and columns as demonstrated below:

```javascript
import { Table } from 'portal' //import Table component

export default function Home() {

  const columns = [
    { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID' },
    { field: 'firstName', headerName: 'First name' },
    { field: 'lastName', headerName: 'Last name' },
    { field: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
  ];

  const data = [
    { id: 1, lastName: 'Snow', firstName: 'Jon', age: 35 },
    { id: 2, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Cersei', age: 42 },
    { id: 3, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Jaime', age: 45 },
    { id: 4, lastName: 'Stark', firstName: 'Arya', age: 16 },
    { id: 7, lastName: 'Clifford', firstName: 'Ferrara', age: 44 },
    { id: 8, lastName: 'Frances', firstName: 'Rossini', age: 36 },
    { id: 9, lastName: 'Roxie', firstName: 'Harvey', age: 65 },
  ];

  return (
    <Table data={data} columns={columns} />
  )
}

```
> Note: Under the hood, Table component uses the [DataGrid Material UI table](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/), and as such all supported params in data and columns are supported. 


#### Table Component Prop Types

Table component accepts two properties:
* **data**: An array of column names with properties: e.g [{field: "col1", headerName: "col1"}, {field: "col2", headerName: "col2"}]

The search`Form` component is a simple search input and submit button. See example of a search form [here](https://catalog-portal-js.vercel.app/search). 

The search `form` requires a submit handler (`handleSubmit`). This handler function receives the search term, and handles actual search. 

In the example below, we demonstrate how to use the `Form` component.

```javascript
import { Form } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  const handleSearchSubmit = (searchQuery) => {
    // Write your custom code to perform search in db
    console.log(searchQuery);
  }

### [Misc Components](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/main/src/components/misc)

These are group of miscellaneous/extra components for extending your portal. They include components like Errors, custom links, etc.

#### [Error Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/misc/Error.js)

The `Error` component is used to display a custom error message.

In the example below, we demonstrate how to use the `Error` component.

```javascript
import { Error } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    <Error message="An error occured when loading the file!" />
  )
}
```

#### Error Component Prop Types

The `Error` component accepts a single property:
* **message**: A string with the error message to display. 
    
    
#### [Custom Component](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/blob/main/src/components/misc/Error.js)

The `CustomLink` component is used to create a link with a consistent style to other portal components. 

In the example below, we demonstrate how to use the `CustomLink` component.

```javascript
import { CustomLink } from 'portal'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    <CustomLink url="/blog" title="Goto Blog" />
  )
}
```

#### CustomLink Component Prop Types

The `CustomLink` component accepts the following properties:

* **url**: A string. The relative or absolute url of the link. 
* **title**: A string. The title of the link

## Concepts and Terms
In this section, we explain some of the terms and concepts used throughtout the portal.js documentation. 
> Some of these concepts are part of official specs, and when appropriate, we'll link to the sources where you can get more details. 
### Dataset
A dataset extends the [Frictionless data package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#metadata) to add an extra organization property. The organization property describes the organization the dataset belongs to, and it should have the following properties:
```javascript
organization = {
 name: "some org name",
 title: "Some optional org title",
 description: "A description of the organization"
}
```
An example of dataset with organization properties is given below:
```javascript
datasets = [{
    organization: {
     name: "some org name",
     title: "Some optional org title",
     description: "A description of the organization"
    },
    title: "Data package title",
    name:  "Data package name",
    description: "description of data package",
    resources: [...],
    licences: [...],
    sources: [...]
    }
]
```

## What happened to Recline?

Portal.JS used to be Recline(JS). If you are looking for the old Recline codebase it still exists:  see the [`recline` branch](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/recline). If you want context for the rename see [this issue](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/issues/520).
