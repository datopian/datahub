# 🌀 PortalJS: The JavaScript framework for data portals

🌀 PortalJS is a framework for rapidly building rich data portal frontends using a modern frontend approach. PortalJS can be used to present a single dataset or build a full-scale data catalog/portal.

Built in JavaScript and React on top of the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) framework. PortalJS assumes a "decoupled" approach where the frontend is a separate service from the backend and interacts with backend(s) via an API. It can be used with any backend and has out of the box support for [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

PortalJS offers a variety of examples (templates) to bootstrap your own data portal in just a few minutes. [Get started now!](#getting-started)

## Features

- 🗺️ Unified sites: present data and content in one seamless site, pulling datasets from a DMS (e.g. CKAN) and content from a CMS (e.g. Wordpress) with a common internal API.
- 👩‍💻 Developer friendly: built with familiar and modern frontend tech such as JavaScript, React and Next.js, so you can take advantage of everything these technologies have to offer: Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, huge number of examples and more!
- 🔋 Batteries included: full set of portal components out of the box e.g. catalog search, dataset showcase, blog, etc.
- 🎨 Easy to theme and customize: installable themes, use standard CSS and React+CSS tooling. Add new routes quickly.
- 🧱 Extensible: quickly extend and develop/import your own React components
- 📝 Well documented: full set of documentation plus the documentation of Next.js and Apollo.

## What is a data portal?

A Data Portal is a gateway to data. That gateway can be big or small, open or restricted. For example, data.gov is open to everyone, whilst an enterprise "intra" data portal is restricted to that enterprise (and perhaps even to certain people within it).

A Data Portal's core purpose is to enable the rapid discovery and use of data. However, as a flexible, central point of truth on an organizations data assets, a Data Portal can become essential data infrastructure and be extended or integrated to provide many additional features:

- Data storage and APIs
- Data visualization and exploration
- Data validation and schemas
- Orchestration and integration of data
- Data Lake coordination and organization

The rise of Data Portals reflect the rapid growth in the volume and variety of data that organizations hold and use. With so much data available internally (and externally) it is hard for users to discover and access the data they need. And with so many potential users and use-cases it is hard to anticipate what data will be needed, when.
