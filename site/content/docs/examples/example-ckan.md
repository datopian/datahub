The ckan-example added to PortalJS is intended to provide users with an easy way to set up a data catalog that can be used to display and share data stores behind a CKAN Backend. With this example, users can quickly set up a web-based portal that allows them to showcase their data and make it accessible to others, all this being done just by adding a simple env variable pointing to a CKAN Deployment.

## Demo

To get a feel of the project, users can check the [live deployment](https://ckan-example.portaljs.org).

## How to use this example as a template

- Create a new app with `create-next-app`:

```
npx create-next-app <app-name> --example https://github.com/datopian/portaljs/tree/main/examples/ckan-example
cd <app-name>
```

- This project uses CKAN as a backend, so you need to point the project to the CKAN Url desired, you can do so by setting up the `DMS` env variable in your terminal or adding a `.env` file with the following content:

```
DMS=<ckan url>
```

- Run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

Congratulations, you now have something similar to this running on `http://localhost:3000`
