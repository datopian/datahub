# Creating new datasets

So far, the PortalJS app we created only has a single page displaying a dataset. Data catalogs and data portals generally showcase many different datasets.

Let's explore how to add and display more datasets to our portal.

## Pages in PortalJS

As you have seen, in this example a dataset page is just a markdown file on disk plus a data file.

To create a new data showcase page we just create a new markdown file in the `content/` folder and a new data file in the `public/` folder. 

Let's do that now. Create a `content/my-incredible-dataset` folder, and inside this new folder create a `index.md` file with the following content:

```markdown
# My Incredible Dataset

This is my incredible dataset.

## Chart 

<LineChart 
    title="US Population By Decade"  
    xAxis="Year"
    yAxis="Population (mi)" 
    data="my-incredible-data.csv"
/>
```

Now, create a file in `public/` named `my-incredible-data.csv` and put the following content inside it:

```bash
Year,Population (mi)
1980,227
1990,249
2000,281
2010,309
2020,331
```

Note that pages are associated with a route based on their pathname, so, to see the new data page, access http://localhost:3000/my-incredible-dataset from the browser. You should see the following:

> [!tip]
> In this tutorial we opted for storing content as markdown files and data as CSV files in the app, but PortalJS can have metadata, data and content stored anywhere.

## Create an index page

Now, let's create an index page. First, create a new folder `content/my-awesome-dataset/` and move `content/index.md` to it. Then, create a new file `content/index.md` and put the following content inside it:

```markdown
# Welcome to my data portal!

List of available datasets:

- [My Awesome Dataset](/my-awesome-dataset)
- [My Incredible Dataset](/my-incredible-dataset)

```

From the browser, access http://localhost:3000. You should see the following:
