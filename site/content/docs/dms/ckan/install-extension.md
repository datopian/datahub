# Installing extensions

A CKAN extension is a Python package that modifies or extends CKAN. Each extension contains one or more plugins that must be added to your CKAN config file to activate the extensionâ€™s features.

In this sections we will teach you only how to install existing extensions. See [next steps](/docs/dms/ckan/create-extension) in case you need to create or modify extensions

## Add new extension

Lets install [Hello World](https://github.com/rclark/ckanext-helloworld) on the portal. For that we need to do 2 thing:

1. Install extension when building docker image
2. Add new extension to CKAN plugins

### Install extension on docker build

For this we need to modify Dockerfile for ckan service. Let's edit it:

```
vi ckan/Dockerfile.dev

# Add following
RUN pip install -e git+https://github.com/rclark/ckanext-helloworld.git#egg=ckanext-helloworld
```

*Note:* In this example we use vi editor, but you can choose any of your choice.

### Add new extension to plugins

We need to modify .env file for that - Search for `CKAN_PLUGINS` and add new extension to the existing list:

```
vi .env

CKAN__PLUGINS=helloworld envvars image_view text_view recline_view datastore datapusher
```

## Check extension is installed

After modifying configuration files you will need to restart the portal. If your CKAN protal is up and running bring it down and re-start

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml stop
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Check what extensions you already have:

http://ckan:5000/api/3/action/status_show

Response should include list of all extensions including `helloworld` in it.

```
"extensions": [
  "envvars",
  "helloworld",
  "image_view",
  "text_view",
  "recline_view",
  "datastore",
  "datapusher"
]
```

### Check the extension is actually working

This extension simply adds new route `/hello/world/name` to the base ckan and says hello

http://ckan:5000/hello/world/John-Doe
