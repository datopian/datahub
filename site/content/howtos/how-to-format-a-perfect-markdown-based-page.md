Welcome to this information guide to help you understand how to format the perfect Markdown-based page for your website. The information here is designed to give you an overview.

## Types of Markdown Styles

There are three types of Markdown options that are supported by Flowershow.

- CommonMark
- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) - a superset of CommonMark
- Obsidian Flavored Markdown - a superset of CommonMark with most GFM functionalities plus its own syntax elements, such as wikilinks, callouts, LaTeX, mermaid diagrams, and more.

Each one has extra functionalities building on top of the previous Markdown option.

Flowershow aims to be fully Obsidian compatible since it supports most Obsidian Flavored Markdown syntax elements and therefore, it is the best to use as an editor.
