Hello, dear readers!

We're excited to announce the official launch of MarkdownDB, an open library to transform markdown content into SQLite database. And now, it has a dedicated website!

## üîç What is MarkdownDB?

MarkdownDB transforms your Markdown content into a queryable, lightweight SQLite database. Imagine being able to treat your collection of markdown files like entries in a database! Ever thought about fetching documents with specific tags or created in the past week? Or, say, pulling up all tasks across documents marked with the "‚è≠Ô∏è" emoji? With MarkdownDB, all of this (and more) is not just possible, but also a breeze.

## üåü Features

- Rich metadata extracted including frontmatter, links and more.
- Lightweight and fast indexing 1000s of files in seconds.
- Open source and extensible via plugin system.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. Start with a collection of markdown files. These could be your blog posts, project docs, or any other type of content. Each file can be enhanced with a YAML frontmatter to include metadata.

2. Index your files with MarkdownDB. Use our npm `mddb` package to index your Markdown files into an SQLite database.

3. And that's it! Now you're all set to query your files with SQL or integrate with the MarkdownDB Node.js API for a more customized experience.
