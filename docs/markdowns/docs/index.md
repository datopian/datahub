<h1 align="center">🌀 Portal.JS
> The JavaScript framework for data portals
</h1>

🌀 `portal.js` is a framework for rapidly building rich data portal frontends using a modern frontend approach. `portal.js` can be used to present a single dataset or build a full-scale data catalog/portal.

`portal.js` is built in Javascript and React on top of the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) framework. `portal` assumes a "decoupled" approach where the frontend is a separate service from the backend and interacts with backend(s) via an API. It can be used with any backend and has out of the box support for [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

## Features
