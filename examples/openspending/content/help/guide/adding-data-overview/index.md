One of the most valuable contributions you can make to the OpenSpending project is to add a new dataset. This section of the guide walks you through the process of adding new data.

A typical workflow for importing a dataset into OpenSpending involves the following steps:

* Gather machine-readable data from a trustworthy source.

* Convert the data to a CSV file in the format expected by OpenSpending, cleaning it to remove inconsistencies and errors.

* Publish the data to the web.

* Create a dataset add the published data as a new data source.

* Model the dataset to assign a logical role to each column in the source table.

* Load the data, or refine the data based on the feedback given by the platform about the data's consistency.

Each of these steps will be explained in detail in the following sections.
