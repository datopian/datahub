This is a repo intended to serve as an example of a data catalog that get its data from a CKAN Instance.

```
npx create-next-app <app-name> --example https://github.com/datopian/portaljs/tree/main/examples/ckan-example
cd <app-name>
```

- This project uses CKAN as a backend, so you need to point the project to the CKAN Url desired, you can do so by setting up the `DMS` env variable in your terminal or adding a `.env` file with the following content:

```
DMS=<ckan url>
```

- Run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```
