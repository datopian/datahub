This demo data portal is designed for https://hatespeechdata.com. It catalogs datasets annotated for hate speech, online abuse, and offensive language which are useful for training a natural language processing system to detect this online abuse.

The site is built on top of [PortalJS](https://portaljs.com/). It catalogs datasets and lists of offensive keywords. It also includes static pages. All of these are stored as markdown files inside the `content` folder.

- .md files inside `content/datasets/` will appear on the dataset list section of the homepage and be searchable as well as having a individual page in `datasets/<file name>`
- .md files inside `content/keywords/` will appear on the list of offensive keywords section of the homepage as well as having a individual page in `keywords/<file name>`
- .md files inside `content/` will be converted to static pages in the url `/<file name>` eg: `content/about.md` becomes `/about`

This is also a Next.JS project so you can use the following steps to run the website locally.
